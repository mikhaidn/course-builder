It represents the *instantaneous rate of change*.\n\n## The Derivative Definition\n\nThe derivative of f(x) at x = a is:\n\n```\nf'(a) = lim(h→0) [f(a + h) - f(a)] / h\n```\n\n## Geometric Interpretation\n\nThe derivative represents the **slope of the tangent line** to the function at a given point.\n\n## Notation\n\nThere are several ways to write derivatives:\n\n- `f'(x)` (Lagrange notation)\n- `df/dx` (Leibniz notation)\n- `Df(x)` (Euler notation)\n\n## Example: Finding a Derivative\n\nLet's find the derivative of f(x) = x²:\n\n```\nf'(x) = lim(h→0) [(x + h)² - x²] / h\n     = lim(h→0) [x² + 2xh + h² - x²] / h\n     = lim(h→0) [2xh + h²] / h\n     = lim(h→0) [2x + h]\n     = 2x\n```\n\nTherefore, the derivative of x² is 2x."

Physics: Motion\n\n- **Velocity** is the derivative of position\n- **Acceleration** is the derivative of velocity\n\nIf s(t) represents position at time t:\n- Velocity: v(t) = s'(t)\n- Acceleration: a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t)\n\n### 2. Economics: Marginal Analysis\n\n- **Marginal cost** = derivative of total cost\n- **Marginal revenue** = derivative of total revenue\n- **Marginal profit** = derivative of total profit\n\n### 3. Optimization Problems\n\nDerivatives help find maximum and minimum values:\n\n1. Find the derivative f'(x)\n2. Set f'(x) = 0 to find critical points\n3. Use the second derivative test to classify extrema\n\n### 4. Related Rates\n\nProblems where multiple quantities change with respect to time:\n\n*Example*: A ladder sliding down a wall - find how fast the top is falling given how fast the bottom is moving away.\n\n## Try It Yourself\n\nThink about other scenarios where rates of change matter:\n- Population growth\n- Chemical reactions\n- Temperature changes\n- Stock prices"
